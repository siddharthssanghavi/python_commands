# If you send the cookies with a request, you dont receive the cookies for the same request. 
#Info about Certificate Files (.der, .pem)-
.der and .pem are encodings. While .cer, .crt, .key are the common extensions. pkcs7 and pkcs12 are may be alternatives to .der and .pem? Dont know.

#Giving files for path in different operating systems: 
Use 
>>> os.path.join( "C:", "meshes", "as" )

#For windows if giving path to a directory withing current working folder:
Give 'directory_name\file_name.extension_name' as path instead of '\directory_name\file_name.extension_name'
Note: Sometimes you may have to use '\\' instead of just one '\'.

#If you are going to write try and except, make sure syntactically all statements inside try are correct and valid. If the syntax is wrong,
then it will fail and come out of try block. Then it becomes very hard to catch the error. eg. In Statseeker code wrote just lnk instead
of lnk['key']. Since lnk was as dictionary, and the expected value was string, it was going out of try to except block and had to spend 
a lot of time to find the error (finally did though!)

#thraed safe operations in python (atomic operations)
refer link - http://effbot.org/pyfaq/what-kinds-of-global-value-mutation-are-thread-safe.htm
excellent explanation - http://effbot.org/zone/thread-synchronization.htm -- see Atomic Operations
When can list be not thread safe - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6319207/are-lists-thread-safe -- refer answer by Thomas
Example of thread unsafety - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11786530/can-python-threads-access-variables-in-the-namespace
FYI - appending to list is thead safe
Are local variables thread safe? Yes, refer https://www.quora.com/Are-local-variables-in-a-python-function-thread-safe for answer
Also, wiki link about thread safety - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_safety

#Very Important concept about lists:
l=[[]]*2
l[0].append(1)
Out [286]: [[1], [1]]
refer https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7255383/python-list-append-behavior


a=[1,2]
b=[3,4]
a.append(b)
b.append(5)
print a
print b
This will print 
a=[1,2,[3,4,5]]
b=[3,4,5] 
This because you dont append copy of list, you append references. 
Do this for appending copy-
a.append(b[:]) or a.append(list(b))
