#slicing, replacing strings in individual series or column from dataframe
country = energy['Country'].str.replace(' \(', '(') ## \ is used as escape character. 
country = energy['Country'].str.split('(').str.get(0)
#slicing using re.split
import re
re.split(' \(+', 'Words (words, words.')[0] #Have to pass each row individually, not on column
###re.split info and illustations:
#format:
re.split(pattern, string[, maxsplit=0])
Explanation:
Split string by the occurrences of pattern. If capturing parentheses are used in pattern, then the text of all groups 
in the pattern are also returned as part of the resulting list. If maxsplit is nonzero, at most maxsplit splits occur, 
and the remainder of the string is returned as the final element of the list.
Illustations:
>>> re.split('\W+', 'Words, words, words.')
['Words', 'words', 'words', '']
>>> re.split('(\W+)', 'Words, words, words.')
['Words', ', ', 'words', ', ', 'words', '.', '']
>>> re.split('\W+', 'Words, words, words.', 1)
['Words', 'words, words.']
#setting, replacing index
df.set_index('Index', drop = True, inplace=True)
df1 = df.reset_index(drop = True)

#Using map(), filter(), reduce() in python 3.0
>>>def f(x): return x % 2 != 0 and x % 3 != 0
#filter
>>> list(filter(f, range(2, 25)))
[5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23]
>>> def cube(x): return x*x*x
#map
>>> list(map(cube, range(1, 11)))
[1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000]
#reduce
>>> import functools
>>> def add(x,y): return x+y
...
>>> functools.reduce(add, range(1, 11))

#Getting index using Boolean mask of a data frame, follwing commands gives list
index = df[df['% Renewable'] == max].index.tolist()

#Getting index using Boolean mask of a series, follwing commands gives list
series[series == series[2]].index[0]

###Always assign a copy of data frame if you want to process it unless you want to change original. If you assign original to new variable 
and change that variable, the original also gets changed, unless the copy has made while assigning it to new variable. 
new_variable_data_frame = old_variable_data_frame.copy()


###There is a difference between type 'numpy.float64' and just 'float'. It may matter depending on the output requirement. 

#Iterative code to read a line from text file in raw format: (Refer documentation for 'f.readlines(filesize = int--(in bytes, optional)' if following method does not suit the purpose)
>>> f = open('university_towns.txt')
>>> for line in f:
>>>   output = repr(line)  # The repr() of a string adds string quotes and backslashes:
>>>   print(output)

#Getting an index of an item in the dataframe:
index = df.index(item)
